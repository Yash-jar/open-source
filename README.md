Name - Yash Raj Singh Roll no. - 210101113 Branch - CSE
I am Yash Raj Singh from Prayagraj, U.P. I am very interested in coding and technical stuff thatâ€™s why I have persuaded CSE. I am very excited about using git to upload my works and contribute to this open-source and learn many things from it.

I want to contribute to open source because by working with this I will get to learn many new things and I will get a chance to contribute to open source and become a part of something big.
